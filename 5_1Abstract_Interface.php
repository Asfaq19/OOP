 1. An Abstract class can have only abstract methods or only non-abstract methods
    or both,but All methods of an interface are abstract by default.

 2. An abstract class can declare properties/methods with access specifier,but interface can declare
   only constant properties(no other type properties) and methods are by default abstract and public.

3.  A class can inherit only one abstract class and multiple inheritence is not possible for abstract class
    but a class can implement more than one interface and can achieve multiple inheritence.

4.If a class contains even a single abstract method that class must be declared as abstract.

5.In an abstract class you can declare and also define methods but in the interface you can only declare your methods.
